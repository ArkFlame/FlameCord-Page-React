# Enhancing Minecraft Server Security with UFW and FlameCord

Minecraft servers need robust security. FlameCord optimizes performance, while UFW blocks invalid connections early to prevent DDoS attacks.

## Why FlameCord and UFW Matter

- **FlameCord:** Enhances server performance and security with load-balancing proxies and antibot systems.
- **UFW:** Filters network traffic to reject invalid connections, reducing resource strain and DDoS risk.

## Benefits of UFW

- **Early Rejection:** Blocks unauthorized access attempts before they reach the server.
- **Simplified Configuration:** User-friendly interface for managing firewall rules.

## Installing and Setting Up UFW

1. **Installation:** `sudo apt-get install ufw`
2. **Enabling:** `sudo ufw enable`
3. **Setting Up Rules:** `sudo ufw limit 25565` (for Minecraft default port with limits)

## Implementing a Simple Limiter with UFW

1. **Define Limit:** `sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp`
2. **Apply Rule:** `sudo ufw limit 22/tcp` (for SSH)

Remember to apply rules for any other port you want opened to the public, but to avoid opening ports you don't want to be exposed.

## Enhancing Security with FlameCord and UFW

Integrate FlameCord with UFW for maximum server security and performance. Regular updates are essential.
